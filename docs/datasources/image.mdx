# Google Compute Image Data Source

Type: `googlecompute-image`

The Google Compute Image data source filters and fetches a GCE image and outputs relevant image metadata for
use with [Google Compute builders](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/googlecompute).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "googlecompute-image" "basic-example" {
  project_id = "debian-cloud"
  filters = "family=debian-12 AND labels.public-image=true"
  most_recent = true
}
```

This configuration selects the most recent GCE image from the `debian-cloud` project that belongs to the`debian-12` family and has the `public-image` label set to `true`.
The data source will fail unless exactly one image is matched. Setting `most_recent = true` ensures only the newest image is selected when multiple matches exist.

## Configuration Reference
