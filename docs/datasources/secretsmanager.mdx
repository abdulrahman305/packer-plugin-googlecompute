# Google Compute Secrets Manager Data Source

The Secrets Manager data source provides information about a Secrets Manager secret version,
including its value and metadata.

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic examples of usage:

```hcl
data "googlecompute-secretsmanager" "basic-example" {
  project_id = "debian-cloud"
  name       = "packer_test_secret"
  key        = "packer_test_key"
}

# usage example of the data source output
locals {
  value = data.googlecompute-secretsmanager.basic-example.value
  payload = data.googlecompute-secretsmanager.basic-example.payload
}
```

Reading key-value pairs from JSON back into a native Packer map can be accomplished
with the [jsondecode() function](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/encoding/jsondecode).
